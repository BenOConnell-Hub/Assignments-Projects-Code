# Assignments-Projects-Code
A repository containing all my code from previous assignments and projects. Whilst the folders are broken into C++, C# and Python, the C++ folder contains .py files as it was important to keep some of the Python files with their accompanying C++ files. Those .py files are usually there to generate plots for the data created in the C++ files.

The Boson Project was completed in my first year of college in the first half of the year 2024.
The Binary Star System project was completed in my second year of college in the second half of the year 2024.
